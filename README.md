# Invio.QueryProvider.Core

This library is intended to provide some abstractions, helpers, and base classes to reduce the boilerplate code required to implement a QueryProvider for various query engines. It is specifically intented to be used to implement a QueryProvider functionally using F# (as opposed to in other .Net languages).
